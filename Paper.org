* Intro
* Escaping the Turing Tarpit
* Examples:
** Tree flattening
** reverse list
** FFT
** integer (nofib / spectral)
** regex_gen (nofib/imaginary)
* Notes:
** no fusion system is perfect
- Given: null, filter and enum
- Fuse: null $ filter p $ enum 0 infty
- Decides whether p is satisfiable.
** Examples
*** On other data structures
** How easy/difficult is it to program in this style?
** Investigate sharing on nuList/good story for fibs
  -> There is no possible state! (Infinite type)
